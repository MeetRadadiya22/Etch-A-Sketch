# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is a fun Etch-A-Sketch game implemented using the Python `turtle` module. The player can control the turtle to draw on the screen using keyboard inputs, similar to the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Features

- Use the keyboard to control the turtle and draw on the screen.
- Clear the screen and reset the turtle's position.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. The `turtle` module is included in the standard Python library, so no additional installations are required.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeetRadadiya22/Etch-A-Sketch.git
